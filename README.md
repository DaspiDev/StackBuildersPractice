Practiced asked by Stack Builders for their hiring process.

How to start:

Clone this repository.

On the main folder use "npm install"

Make sure you have the backend already started, if it's not started the fetch might fail.

When it is ready use "npm start"

For testing use "npm test"

If the data fetching still fails you might need to install this chrome extension and use it on the browser as it ignores CORS problems: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf

I had a lot of fun making this small app, I didn't know much about web scrappes and found the learning process really fun!
